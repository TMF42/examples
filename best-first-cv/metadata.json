  "description": "Script to select the `n` best features for modeling a given dataset,\nusing a greedy algorithm. It only works for classification problems,\ni.e., this script needs a categorical objective field.\n\n**How the greedy algorithm works:**\n\nThe algorithm initializes the set of `S` features taking into\naccount the pre-selected best features from the dataset-id selected as\n**input. If there are not pre-selected features, `S` will be empty.**\n\nFor each iteration: \n\n  - For each feature `f` in the dataset-id selected as input that is not\nin `S`, it trains a model with feature set `S + f`. By default, the\nalgorithm builds decision trees, however you can select another\nalgorithms and its parametrization by configuring the options. For\nexample, if you set `{number_of_models: 40}` ensembles with 40 models\nwill be trained at each iteration.\n\n  - Then each model built with the feature set `S + f` is evaluated\nusing k-fold cross-validation. \n\n  - The algorithm greedily selects the feature `f` with the best\nperformance using the metric `average_phi` minus the standard deviation\n(derived from the cross-validation) to use the worst case as metric of\nperformance.\n\n  - If the feature `f` improves the performance of the last\niteration, i.e. if the improvement is higher than the % set as the\nearly-stop-performance, it is added it to `S`.\n\n  - If the feature `f` have not improved the performance of the model,\ni.e. the improvement is lower than the percentage set as\n`early-stop-performance`, after a certain number of iterations (set by\n`max-low-perf-iterations`) , the execution will stop. \n\nFind more info in [readme](https://github.com/whizzml/examples/blob/master/best-first-cv/readme.md)",
